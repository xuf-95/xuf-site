Iâ€™m a dedicated Big Data Developer with over three years of hands-on experience in the ever-evolving world of data. My journey began with a passion for understanding how massive datasets can drive business value, leading me to specialize in data processing, analysis, and optimization using tools like Apache Spark, Hadoop, and Kafka. I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy solving complex problems to deliver high-quality solutions. Outside of coding, I enjoy staying active, exploring new technologies, and contributing to open-source projects.
