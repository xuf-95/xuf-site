我做事，我尝试，我建造，我想要取得进步，我想让我做的东西使得自己、使得公司、使得家庭、使得社会变得更好。但我从未设定过目标。这不是我做事的方式。
目标是当你到达时就会消失的东西。一旦你到达了，它就消失了。你总是可以设置另一个，我只是不按这样的步骤行事。

我只是做我正在做的事情，然后就到了现在的地方。今天我继续以同样的方式对待工作和生活。
你可以不给自己设定目标，因为目标是你做事的副产品。只要你按照自己的信念，不断地努力去做事、去尝试，就可以了，至于能做到哪一步，顺其自然就好了。

有一句成语"功不唐捐"，就是这个意思，付出的努力不会白费。
西方人说："Passion never fails"（激情不会失败），也是同样的意思。

建造那些你想要建造的东西，努力做事，认真生活，人生可以没有目标。
新的一年，我想我也是这样，没有目的地，就是向前走。

I can’t remember having a goal. An actual goal.
There are things I’ve wanted to do, but if I didn’t do them I’d be fine with that too. There are targets that would have been nice to hit, but if I didn’t hit them I wouldn’t look back and say I missed them.
I don’t aim for things that way.
I do things, I try things, I build things, I want to make progress, I want to make things better for me, my company, my family, my neighborhood, etc. But I’ve never set a goal. It’s just not how I approach things.


A goal is something that goes away when you hit it. Once you’ve reached it, it’s gone. You could always set another one, but I just don’t function in steps like that.
When you shift from 1st to 2nd, 1st is behind you. Then from 2nd to 3rd, 2nd is behind you. I approach things continuously, not in stops. I just want to keep going — whatever happens along the way is just what happens.
I consider Basecamp, my current business, as one continuous line back from when I sold the first thing I ever remember making — a logo for $50 (which happened to be for Andrei Heramischuk— who knew!). I was 16 or something like that at the time. I didn’t have a goal to make two logos, or to be able to charge $5000 for a logo. I just made logos. And then I made software. And then I made web sites. And now I make software again. No goals in the process that I remember.
I just worked at whatever I was working on and ended up wherever I am. I continue to approach work and life that same way today.
If I’ve used the word goal, I didn’t mean it that way. It was just the word I picked, a synonym for something else.
I really like what Jim Coudal said about goals:
“The reason that most of us are unhappy most of the time is that we set our goals not for the person we’re going to be when we reach them, but we set our goals for the person we are when we set them.
That pretty much sums it up for me.
